# Changelog

All notable changes to the Face Recognition System will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-17

### Added
- Initial release of Face Recognition System
- Face detection using OpenCV Haar Cascade classifiers
- Face recognition using LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm
- Command-line interface (`example.py`) for easy usage
- Support for training with known faces from a directory
- Comprehensive logging and error handling
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Documentation:
  - README.md with installation and usage instructions
  - QUICKSTART.md for quick start guide
  - advanced_example.py with advanced usage examples
- Configuration files:
  - requirements.txt with dependencies
  - setup.py for package installation
  - .gitignore for Python projects

### Features
- **Face Detection**: Detect faces in images without recognition
- **Face Recognition**: Recognize known faces with confidence scores
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple images at once
- **Flexible API**: Easy-to-use Python API for custom integrations
- **Real-time Support**: Examples for webcam face recognition
- **Statistics**: Gather statistics about detected and recognized faces

### Technical Details
- Uses OpenCV 4.5+ with contrib modules
- No complex dependencies (no dlib required)
- Python 3.7+ compatible
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)

### Testing
- Unit tests covering:
  - System initialization
  - Face detection with invalid inputs
  - Face recognition without known faces
- All tests pass successfully

## Known Limitations
- Recognition accuracy depends on training data quality
- Performance depends on image size and complexity
- Requires good lighting for optimal results
- Front-facing photos work best

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add support for video file processing
- [ ] Implement face clustering
- [ ] Add more recognition algorithms (Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces)
- [ ] Create web interface
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration support
- [ ] Implement face alignment for better accuracy
